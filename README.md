# PyTorch-Models
- Implement PyTorch models as seen in the below figures.
- Divide your data into train, validation and test. Best model is the one with minimum validation loss (or maximum validation accuracy). Use stochastic, mini-batch, or batch mode and any optimizer you want.
  Try to obtain the best test accuracy
